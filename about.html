        <h1>My Journey to Tech</h1>
        <p> 
        For years, I was the person people called when something new needed to be built — a community project, a youth leadership program, or an organization from the ground up.
        I’ve been a social entrepreneur, a tour guide, a teacher, a founder, and a father.
        Most of my adult life has been spent in spaces where human complexity is the norm, and easy answers are rare.
        </p>
            
        <p>So why am I learning to code?</p>

        <p>
        The shift wasn’t sudden, but it became urgent. After October 7th, like many others in this region, I found the ground beneath me changed. 
        The work that had always felt essential—helping communities navigate conflict—no longer felt sustainable, at least not in the same way. 
        I was supporting others while struggling to support my own family. I needed stability. But I wasn’t ready to abandon meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
        That’s when I started to look at technology—not as an escape, but as a tool. 
        Tech can build systems. It can scale good ideas. It can connect people across boundaries. And unlike peace-building, 
        which often lives in moments and conversations, tech leaves artifacts—codebases, platforms, tools—that can outlast us.
        </p>

        <p>
        At first, it was intimidating. I’m used to text—Torah, political philosophy, policy briefs—not text editors. 
        I’ve facilitated negotiations, but the first time I typed <strong>git push origin main,</strong> I was just hoping I didn’t break the internet.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        And over time, something familiar emerged. Clean code is a form of empathy. 
        Building a backend is another way of structuring relationships. Frontend logic is storytelling. 
        And debugging? That’s just conflict resolution in disguise.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Today, I’m a full-stack developer in training. 
        I’m building my skills in React, Node.js, and Python — not to escape the world I came from, but to bring its values with me into new spaces. 
        Whether I’m designing an app or contributing to an open-source tool, I’m still doing what I’ve always done: listening deeply, 
        making connections, and helping people build something better together.
        </p>
        <p>
             didn’t lose my passion for building community—I just changed my tools. And as I grow as a developer, 
             I’m exploring where meaningful tech can support real-world connection, access, and impact.
        </p>
        <p>This is my pivot. It’s not a departure. It’s a translation.</p>
